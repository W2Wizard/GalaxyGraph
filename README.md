A recreation of the 'Holy Graph' used on 42's Intranet. The goal of this project is to
introduce a new graph for the [Improved Intra project](https://github.com/FreekBes/improved_intra/) and build a cursus editor for staff.

# How to build

Though this project uses typescript, its intent is to be used with plain javascript in a product. TS is only used for development and the usage of auto-complete.

``` bash
npm install
npm run build   # use npm run build-windows on Windows
```

or

```bash
tsc tsconfig.json
```

Then open the `index.html` in the www folder.
