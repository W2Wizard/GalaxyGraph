A recreation of the 'Holygraph' used on the intranet. The goal of this project is to
introduce a new graph for the Improve Intra project and build a cursus editor for staff.

# How to build

Though this project uses typescript, its intent is to be used with plain javascript in a product. TS is only used for development and the usage of auto-complete.

``` bash
npm install
npm run build
```

or

```bash
tsc tsconfig.json
```

Then open the `html.index` in the www folder.
